                Participants can make anything they want. Prizes will be
                given to the most creative and unique projects.
                The only restriction is that projects must be created
                during the Hackathon time period
                (refer to the above schedule).

                Yes! We highly encourage teamwork. Participants
                may work alone or in teams of up to 4 people. The
                "group-search" channel on our Discord server can help you
                find teammates. Participants may also work solo
                if they prefer that.

                Absolutely. Everyone is welcome to participate in this
                Hackathon and we will be posting useful resources under
                the "resources" channel of our Discord server. These
                resources will be handpicked from our team who has
                developed many full stack web and phone applications. We
                will divide these resources by beginner, intermediate,
                and advanced.

                Indeed! Please post all debugging questions under the
                "debugging" channel of our Discord server. We will try our
                best to answer as many questions as possible.

                If credit is given through code comments and the code is not
                under copyright restrictions, using code from external
                resources is fine.

                Yes, every teammate should have a Devpost account. BUT, only
                one person should submit the project on Devpost. When
                submitting a project, Devpost will allow you to add
                teammates, so the project will also be linked to their
                accounts.

                a project to be valid. The submission deadline is
                included in the schedule above

                Videos are intended to be demos of the invention. You can
                include anything you want (voice overs, explaining code,
                  etc.) but those are all optional. The nicer the
                  presentation of your innovation is, the more likely you
                  are to win a prize (since presentation is one of the
                  judging criteria). These projects can also go on your
                  resume if youâ€™re planning to apply for jobs or
                  internships in the future, so we suggest making decent
                  videos. Max time for a video is 5 minutes.

                Source code for the project should be linked in the Devpost
                submission. Pushing source code to GitHub is preferred, but
                participants may upload their code as a zip file to other
                places like Google Drive or Dropbox if that is easier for
                them.

                <p>
                  Projects will be judged based off creativity and
                  uniqueness. The novelty of ideas matters, more creative
                  ideas do better here, but the execution of the idea
                  matters too. See the Presentation category for
                  information about this.

                  presentation? Was it well-implemented? Are there any
                  obvious flaws or glitches?
